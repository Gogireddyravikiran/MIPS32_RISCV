# What is RISCV ? 
Pronounced "risk-five," RISC-V is an ISA based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. Unlike most other ISA designs, it is provided under a open source license that does not require fees to use.

## 1.RISC-V RV32I

This project provides an insight into the working of a few important instructions of the instruction set of a pipelined Reduced Instruction Set Computer - Five(RISC-V) Instruction Set Architecture suitable for use across wide-spectrum of Applications from low power embedded devices to high performance Cloud based Server processors. The base RISC-V is a 32-bit processor with 31 general-purpose registers, so all the instructions are 32-bit long. Some Applications where the RISC-V processors have begun to make some significant threads are in Artificial intelligence and machine learning, Embedded systems, Ultra Low power processing systems etc.
